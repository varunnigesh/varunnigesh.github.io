I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in Geotechnical Engineering at University of California, Los Angeles. I am still exploring the broad domain of Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering. My ongoing research focuses on the effect of Fines on the liquefaction triggering analyses. I am jointly advised by Prof. Jonathan Stewart and Prof. Scott Brandenberg.
